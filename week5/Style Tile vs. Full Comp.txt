The method that works best for me are full comps. I personally can put my ideas together better through a full comp. Styles tiles are too vague for me. They are good for kind of setting the mood for a project, but the full comp gives you an overall better idea of how the layout and style of the page actually is. If you are starting from scratch I thinks it better to start with a full comp. If you are just trying to change the mood or feel of a website that is already made, I think a style tile would work better. Full comps will take a little longer, because you have to come up with the layout also. However, even though a style tile will probably take less time, it can be hard to visualize how the styles will actually look as a final end product.
