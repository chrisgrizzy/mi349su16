<h1>5 Design Principles</h1>

<h2>DanielFiller.com</h2>
<p>The design principle I chose for this website is chunking. Chunking is a method which splits concepts into small pieces or "chunks" of information to make reading and understanding faster and easier. In the "What I Know" section all of his skills are showed in a very easy yo read bar graph format. Thereis a short paragraph that also gives a general explanatation of all his skills. I think displays chunking, becuase the designer took all of skills and condensed them in a way which it is easily readable, and can be remembered.</p>

<h2>AlexFalcone.com</h2>
<p>
  The design principle I chose for this website is Ockham's Razor. This principle states that you should choose the most simple design. I believe this website is a perfect example of this, because the wesbite's main page is not cluttered with a bunch of links or menu options. As you scroll down the page there are just thumbnails of examples of projects he ha worked on. This is a very simple design that works perfectly for a portfolio website, focused on showcasing work.

<h2>YouTube.com</h2>
YouTube is a good example for modularity. Modularity is the extent to which you can break aspects of a website into smaller modules. The website allows the user to use different widgets to customize their experience.The widgets themselves can be customizwed, and this allows various features of the website to be broken into smaller pieces

<h2>Google.com</h2>
<p>Googlecom is an example of Hick's Law. Hick's law is a law that states, the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases. Google's website makes the decisions really simple for you. There is nothing on the website but a search bar, which is exactly what the website is intended for. There are not a lot of menu buttons and advertisements on the homepage. </p>

<h2>Tumblr.com</h2> 
<p>Tumblr uses the design principle of afforadance. Affordance is a perceived signal or clue that an object may be used to perform a particular action. Tumblr has buttons on the top that have icons that give an example of what kinds of actions they perform. By using thiese icons, it makes it easier for users to get an idea of what that particular button does. The sites communicates affordance by using real-world object as a metaphor such as the camera icon, video camera icon, and mail icon.  </p>
